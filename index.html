 <br>1. local storage stores data with no expiration date<br>
 <br>2. session storage stores data for one session (data is lost when 
     the browser tab is closed)<br>

<br>//what are pseudo selector?<br>

<br>.In css pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies
 a special state of the selected elements<br> 

<br>// Explain position?<br>
 <br>.The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element . <br>  
 <br>.There are five position values :<br>

<br> 1.static<br>
 <br>2.relative<br>
 <br>3.fixed<br>
 <br>4.absolute <br>

<br>  => The css box-sizing property allows us to include the padding 
   and border in an elements total width and height.<br>

 <br> // call, apply, bind<br>
  
  <br>.call()<br>
  <br>with the call() method , takes arguments separatly. the apply() method
  takes arguments as an array.<br>
  <br>.apply()<br>  
  <br>with this method , you can write a method that can 
  be used on different objects.<br>
   <br>.bind()<br>
    <br>An object can borrow a method from another object. <br> 
<br>// async/await<br>
 <br>. async and await make promises easier to write<br>
 <br>=>async makes a function returns a promise.<br>
 <br>=>await makes a function wait for a promise.<br>
 <br>. promises<br>
 <br>=> A promise is a javascript object that links producing
    code and consuming code. <br>  
 <br>=> callback<br>  
  <br>. A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.<br>
  <br>. This technique allows a function to call another function.<br>
  <br>. A callback function can run after another funciton has finished.<br>

<br>// callback hell<br>

   in code of asynchronus programming.<br> 

<br>// map, filter ,reduce<br>
 <br>=> map<br> 
 <br>. A map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.<br>  
 <br>.A map remembers the original insertion order of the keys. <br>
 <br>=> filter<br>
  <br>. This method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function <br>  
     and does not execute the function for empty elements and does not change the original array.<br>
  <br>=> reduce <br>
  <br>. The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element .<br> 
  <br>. This method does not change the original array.<br>


<br>// spread operator?<br>

<br>Spread operator (...)allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array .<br>

<br>//ES6 features.<br>

 <br>.let keyword<br>
 <br>.const keyword<br>
 <br>.map objects<br>
 <br>.set objects<br>
 <br>.arrow functions<br> 
 <br>.classes<br>
 <br>.promises<br>
 <br>.symbol<br> 
 <br>.object entries and etc ..<br>
